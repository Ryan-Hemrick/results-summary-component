## My process
- Utilized CSS Grid on the **body** element to vertically and horizontally center the component
- Used a *flex container* wrapper element to stack the two main sections with a *flex-direction* of 'column' on mobile, and then adjust to a *flex-direction* of 'row' for larger device sizes
- Used additional flexbox positioning in areas where I needed to get multiple elements to sit next to eachother and respond to screen resize
- Used one media query to adjust **flexbox** behavior, positoning, and spacing for larger devices


### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned
- How to work with CSS Gradients
- Practiced using various *flexbox* properties to create a responsive layout
